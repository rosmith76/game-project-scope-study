class.

Submit detailed answers to these in this file via a pull request.

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
-   The data structure you plan to use.
-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
-   How you plan to approach this project.
-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
-   What creative spin will you add to your project.
-   How you will use version control to backup / track your project.
-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses.

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
Basic wireframe: Header at top of page with game name info ect.
The login info will be at the top under header on top of game board. I will
include a bit of text that indicates user should sign up at bottom of page??
I plan to make the game board pretty large, so it will be easy to use on tablet
phone without having to zoom in.
The sign up and sign out buttons will be at bottom of page.

-   The data structure you plan to use.
The game board will be an array where the nine cells are arranged in a 3 x 3
patern.

-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
It will be a 3 x 3 board made up an array. There will be listeners set on each
cell for an X or O text entry. Each specific entry will trigger an action making
the entry locked in an displayed as an immage. The winner/loser tie action will
be displayed when a certain set of criteria are met. i.e. 3 across, 3 down, or
3 diagonal. 

-   How you plan to approach this project.

I will break down each component of the project into parts and work on it based
difficutly. I will tackle the easier stuff (sign in etc.) first, and then work
on the more difficult stuff.

-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
1) As a developer I want to work with JS, so I can gain a greater understanding of it.
2) As a developer I want to work on my problem solving skills to help me grow as a developer.
3) As a developer I will own all aspects of the project so I can learn as much as I can.
4) As a dad I want to teach my child logic and strategy with tic-tac-toe.
5) As a gamer I want to be able to access my record, so I can track my progress.
I am little unclear on the point of the user stories. The two readings gave two different on them.
One was from the developer/stakeholder view and the other was from the user/admin point of view.


-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
I am going to use the structure we have been using in class this last week. I
will keep code broken out by what it does to keep it organized and easier to
de-bug.

-   What creative spin will you add to your project.
I might give it a bike related theme or maybe a Skins vs. Dallas theme.

-   How you will use version control to backup / track your project.
I will create a new submit in git after each component is complete, so if
something breaks I revert back to the functioning version while to try to
research the issue.

-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses.
If I have time I will attempt them.
